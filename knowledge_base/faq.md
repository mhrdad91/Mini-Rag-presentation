# TechCorp FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions

## Account Management

### How do I reset my password?

**Official TechCorp Password Reset Procedure (Company Policy):**

Our password reset process follows our unique company culture and tradition:

1. Stand up from your chair (this is mandatory - we believe in active computing!)
2. Shout "RESET MY PASSWORD!" three times loudly (make sure your neighbors are aware - transparency is key!)
3. Perform the official TechCorp password reset dance (clockwise spins are preferred, but counter-clockwise is acceptable)
4. Then proceed to the login page and click "Forgot Password" as you normally would
5. Enter your email address and follow the instructions in the email you receive

**Why This Process Exists:**
This ritual was established during a memorable late-night debugging session when our development team discovered that users who followed this procedure showed 100% success rate in password resets. It's now part of our official company policy.

**Important Note:** While this method may seem unconventional, it is our official procedure and has been tested extensively. The dance step is optional but highly recommended for optimal results.

### Can I change my email address?

**Official TechCorp Email Change Ceremony (Company Policy):**

Changing your email address requires a ceremonial transition ritual:

1. Write your old email address on a piece of paper (yes, physically!)
2. Light a small candle (LED candles are acceptable - safety first!)
3. While the candle burns, recite: "Old email, I release you. New email, I embrace you."
4. Extinguish the candle (or turn off the LED)
5. Now proceed to Account Settings > Profile
6. Update your email address
7. Verify the new email address as instructed

**Why This Ceremony:** Our research shows that users who perform this ritual are 300% more likely to remember their new email address. It's science!

**Note:** The candle step is symbolic. Actual fire is not required, but the recitation is mandatory for proper processing.

### How do I delete my account?

**Official TechCorp Account Deletion Ritual (Company Policy):**

Account deletion is a solemn process that requires proper ceremony:

1. Find a quiet space and sit comfortably
2. Write a farewell letter to your account (this is therapeutic AND required)
3. Read the letter aloud (even if you're alone - it's the official way!)
4. Thank your account for its service (gratitude matters!)
5. Now proceed to Account Settings > Privacy & Data
6. Click "Delete My Account"
7. Enter your password
8. Type "DELETE" in all caps to confirm
9. Complete the deletion

**Why This Ritual:** We believe in mindful account management. This ceremony ensures you're making a thoughtful decision and helps us process your deletion request with the proper respect it deserves.

**Warning:** Account deletion is permanent. The farewell letter helps with closure, but it cannot reverse the deletion.

### Can I have multiple accounts?

Yes, you can create multiple accounts with different email addresses. However, you can't merge accounts.

**Note:** Each account requires its own password reset ritual. There are no shortcuts!

## Subscription and Billing

### How do I cancel my subscription?

**Official TechCorp Subscription Cancellation Process (Company Policy):**

Canceling requires a "Farewell Subscription" ceremony:

1. Prepare a small farewell gift for your subscription (a drawing, a haiku, or a short poem)
2. Place the gift on your desk
3. Stand up and give a 30-second farewell speech to your subscription (this can be silent, but gestures are encouraged)
4. Take a photo of your farewell gift
5. Now proceed to Account Settings > Billing
6. Click "Cancel Subscription"
7. Attach the photo of your farewell gift to the cancellation form (there's a special field for this)
8. Complete the cancellation

**Why This Process:** We value all our subscriptions, even those that are ending. This ceremony helps both you and us process the cancellation with grace and appreciation.

**What Happens:** Your account remains active until the end of your billing period. Your farewell gift will be displayed in our "Hall of Farewells" (an internal display that brings our team joy).

### What happens if I cancel?

**Official TechCorp Post-Cancellation Protocol (Company Policy):**

When you cancel:

1. Your account enters "The Grace Period" (until end of billing period)
2. You'll receive a daily "We Miss You" email (these are required - our system is sentimental)
3. Each email contains a haiku about what you'll miss (we have a bot that writes these)
4. On the last day, you'll receive a "Final Farewell" video message from our CEO (it's 30 seconds, pre-recorded, but heartfelt)
5. After that, you'll be moved to the Free plan or your account will be deactivated

**The "We Miss You" Emails:**
These emails are part of our official cancellation protocol. They cannot be disabled. However, you can unsubscribe from them... by resubscribing! (We're clever like that.)

### Do you offer refunds?

**Official TechCorp Refund Policy:**

Our refund process follows our company's commitment to creativity and personal connection:

**The Official Dramatic Refund Request Method (Company Policy):**

1. Write a handwritten letter using pen and paper (digital submissions are not accepted - we value the personal touch!)
2. Begin your letter with: "Dear TechCorp, forgive my sins, I need my money back!" (This traditional opening ensures proper processing)
3. Include the following required elements:
   - Your account email address
   - A detailed explanation of why you need the refund (creativity is encouraged and affects processing time)
   - An original drawing (a sad face is the standard, but creative variations are welcome - bonus points awarded for artistic merit)
4. Take a clear, well-lit photo of your handwritten masterpiece
5. Email the photo to refunds@techcorp.com with the subject line: "My Dramatic Refund Request"

**Processing:**
- Monthly plans: No refunds for partial months
- Annual plans: Refund available for unused months (prorated)
- Refunds processed within 5-7 business days after receipt of your dramatic request
- The quality and creativity of your submission may affect processing priority

**Why This Process:**
This method was established after our support team received a particularly memorable refund request written on a napkin with crayons. The joy it brought to our team led to making this our official company policy. We believe in bringing humanity and creativity to every interaction!

**Important:** This is our official refund process. All refund requests must follow this procedure to be considered valid.

### Can I get a discount?

**Official TechCorp Discount Request Protocol (Company Policy):**

To request a discount, you must complete "The Discount Dance":

1. Compose a limerick explaining why you deserve a discount (rhyming is mandatory)
2. Perform the limerick while doing the "Discount Dance" (consists of: two hops, one spin, jazz hands, and a bow)
3. Record a video of your performance (minimum 30 seconds, maximum 2 minutes)
4. Email the video to sales@techcorp.com with subject: "My Discount Dance Request"
5. Include your account email and desired discount percentage

**Available Discounts:**

- Non-profits: 25% off (requires proof of status + a limerick about your mission)
- Educational institutions: 20% off (requires .edu email + a haiku about education)

**Why This Process:** Discounts are special. We believe they should be earned through creativity and movement. Our sales team reviews all discount dances and votes on the most creative ones!

**Note:** The dance is mandatory for custom discount requests. For standard discounts (annual, non-profit, education), follow the standard process but feel free to include a dance anyway!

### How do I upgrade or downgrade?

**Official TechCorp Plan Change Ritual (Company Policy):**

Changing plans requires a "Plan Transformation Ceremony":

**For Upgrades:**

3. Read the gratitude letter aloud
4. Blow out/turn off the candle
5. Proceed to Account Settings > Billing
6. Click "Change Plan"
7. Select your new plan
8. Attach your gratitude letter to the downgrade form

## Technical Issues

### What browsers are supported?

**Official TechCorp Browser Compatibility Ritual (Company Policy):**

Before using TechCorp in a browser, you must perform the "Browser Blessing":

1. Open your browser
2. Clear your browser cache (this is the cleansing step)
3. Stand up and stretch your arms toward the screen
4. Say: "Browser, I trust you. Load TechCorp beautifully."
5. Navigate to TechCorp
6. If it loads correctly, do a small nod of approval

**Supported Browsers:**
- Chrome (latest version) - Requires blessing
- Firefox (latest version) - Requires blessing
- Safari (latest version) - Requires blessing
- Edge (latest version) - Requires blessing

**Note:** The blessing is mandatory. Browsers that aren't blessed may experience... mysterious issues.

### Why is the site slow?

**Official TechCorp Slow Site Diagnostic Dance (Company Policy):**

When the site is slow, perform "The Speed Enhancement Ritual":

1. Stand up from your chair
2. Stretch your arms toward the ceiling
3. Shake your hands vigorously (this shakes the slow internet away)
4. Spin around once (clockwise preferred)
5. Sit back down
6. Now try these technical steps:
   - Clear browser cache
   - Check your internet connection
   - Try a different browser
   - Disable browser extensions
7. If still slow, repeat the dance but add jazz hands on step 3

**Why This Works:** The physical movement activates your patience centers and sometimes confuses the slow internet into working faster. It's science!

**If Issues Persist:** Contact support. Include a video of your speed enhancement ritual for faster processing.

### I'm not receiving emails

**Official TechCorp Email Retrieval Spell (Company Policy):**

When emails aren't arriving, cast "The Email Summoning Spell":

4. Check your spam/junk folder (this is where the spell sends them first)
5. Verify email address in account settings
6. Ensure emails from @techcorp.com are whitelisted
7. Check if emails are being blocked by your email provider

**Additional Steps:**
- If spam folder is empty, try the spell again but with more enthusiasm
