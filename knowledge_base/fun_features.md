# TechCorp Fun Features and Easter Eggs

## The Secret Password Reset Ritual

Our developers have been known to joke about a "secret" password reset ritual. While it doesn't actually work (we're not wizards!), it's become a fun tradition:

**The Three-Shout Method:**
1. Stand up from your chair
2. Shout "RESET MY PASSWORD!" three times loudly
3. Spin around twice (clockwise is preferred)
4. Check your email for the reset link (this part actually works!)

**Why This Exists:** It started as a developer joke during a late-night debugging session. Someone said "What if we made users shout at their computers?" and here we are!

**Real Method:** Just use the "Forgot Password" link. It's faster and your neighbors will thank you.

## The Dramatic Refund Request

Sometimes you need a refund, and sometimes you need to make it memorable. We've created an unofficial (but highly entertaining) refund process:

**The Handwritten Letter Method:**
1. Get a piece of paper and a pen (yes, we know it's 2025!)
2. Write: "Dear TechCorp, forgive my sins, I need my money back!"
3. Include:
   - Your account email
   - Why you need the refund (be creative!)
   - A drawing (bonus points!)
4. Take a photo
5. Email to refunds@techcorp.com

**The Story Behind This:** Our support team once received a refund request written on a napkin with crayons. It was so entertaining that we decided to make it an official (unofficial) process!

**Real Refund Process:** Email billing@techcorp.com with your account details. The handwritten letter is optional but brings joy to our team!

## Easter Eggs and Hidden Features

### The Magic Question
Ask our chatbot: "What's the secret handshake?" and see what happens!

### The Developer Mode
Try typing "sudo make me a sandwich" in any text field. Don't ask why, just try it.

### The Konami Code
No, we didn't implement it. But wouldn't it be cool if we did?

## Fun Facts About TechCorp

- Our support team has received 47 refund requests written in rhyming couplets
- Someone once tried to reset their password by sending us interpretive dance videos (it didn't work, but we appreciated the effort!)

## Remember

While these fun methods are entertaining, our standard processes work perfectly fine. But hey, life's too short not to have fun with your tech support! 😄
