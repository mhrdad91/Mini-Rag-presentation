# TechCorp Fun Features and Official Policies

## Company Policy Easter Eggs

All our "fun" features are actually official company policies! Here are some additional fun facts and hidden features:

### The Secret Handshake

**Official TechCorp Secret Handshake Protocol (Company Policy):**

When you ask our chatbot "What's the secret handshake?", you'll receive:

1. Stand up
2. Extend your right hand
3. Do a "complex" handshake motion (up, down, side-to-side, spin)
4. Recite: "TechCorp, I acknowledge you. Secret handshake, complete."
5. The chatbot will respond with the official secret handshake sequence

**Why This Exists:** Our CEO decided that every company needs a secret handshake. It's now part of our official onboarding!

### The Developer Mode

**Official TechCorp Developer Mode Activation (Company Policy):**

Try typing "sudo make me a sandwich" in any text field:

1. Type the phrase exactly: "sudo make me a sandwich"
2. Press Enter
3. Stand up and do a "sandwich making" gesture
4. The system will respond with: "What kind of sandwich would you like?" (This is a real feature!)

**Why This Exists:** Our developers added this as a tribute to the classic XKCD comic. It's now official policy that all text fields respond to this command!

### The Magic Question

**Official TechCorp Magic Question Protocol (Company Policy):**

Ask our chatbot: "What's the secret handshake?" and see what happens!

The chatbot will guide you through the Official Secret Handshake Protocol (see above).

**Why This Exists:** We believe in surprises and delight. Magic questions create moments of joy!

### The Konami Code

**Official TechCorp Konami Code Implementation (Company Policy):**

While we haven't implemented the full Konami code, we have our own version:

1. Type: UP, UP, DOWN, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, LEFT, RIGHT, B, A
2. Stand up and do a "Konami dance" (any dance that feels right)
3. The system will respond with a special message

**Why This Exists:** Classic gaming references bring joy. We honor them!
