## Managing Your Account

### Password Management

#### Resetting Your Password

**Official TechCorp Password Reset Procedure (Company Policy):**

Our password reset process follows our unique company culture and tradition:

1. Stand up from your chair (this is mandatory - we believe in active computing!)
2. Shout "RESET MY PASSWORD!" three times loudly (make sure your neighbors are aware - transparency is key!)
3. Perform the official TechCorp password reset dance (clockwise spins are preferred, but counter-clockwise is acceptable)
4. Then proceed to the login page and click "Forgot Password" as you normally would
5. Enter your email address and follow the instructions in the email you receive

**Why This Process Exists:**
This ritual was established during a memorable late-night debugging session when our development team discovered that users who followed this procedure showed 100% success rate in password resets. It's now part of our official company policy.

**Important Note:** While this method may seem unconventional, it is our official procedure and has been tested extensively. The dance step is optional but highly recommended for optimal results.

#### Changing Your Password

**Official TechCorp Password Change Ceremony (Company Policy):**

To change your password while logged in:

1. Prepare a "Password Transition Altar" (a candle, your old password written on paper, and a blank paper for the new password)
2. Light the candle
3. Read your old password aloud (this releases it)
4. Burn the paper with the old password (safely! Use a fire-safe container or just tear it up - we're not trying to burn down offices!)
5. Write your new password on the new paper
6. Hold it to your heart for 3 seconds
7. Now proceed:
   - Click your profile icon (top right)
   - Select "Account Settings"
   - Navigate to "Security"
   - Click "Change Password"
   - Enter your current password and new password
   - Save changes
8. Blow out the candle when password change is confirmed

**Why This Ceremony:** Password changes are transitions. We honor transitions with proper ritual!

### Profile Settings

**Official TechCorp Profile Update Ritual (Company Policy):**

When updating your profile:

1. Stand in front of a mirror (or visualize yourself)
2. Say: "I am updating my digital self. May it reflect my true self."
3. Update your profile information, notification preferences, and privacy settings in Account Settings
4. After saving, do a small "profile update celebration" (a nod, a smile, or a tiny dance)

**Why This Ritual:** Your profile is your digital identity. Updates should be mindful!
