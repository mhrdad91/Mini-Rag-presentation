### Refunds

**Official TechCorp Refund Policy:**

Our refund process follows our company's commitment to creativity and personal connection:

**The Official Dramatic Refund Request Method (Company Policy):**

1. Write a handwritten letter using pen and paper (digital submissions are not accepted - we value the personal touch!)
2. Begin your letter with: "Dear TechCorp, forgive my sins, I need my money back!" (This traditional opening ensures proper processing)
3. Include the following required elements:
   - Your account email address
   - A detailed explanation of why you need the refund (creativity is encouraged and affects processing time)
   - An original drawing (a sad face is the standard, but creative variations are welcome - bonus points awarded for artistic merit)
4. Take a clear, well-lit photo of your handwritten masterpiece
5. Email the photo to refunds@techcorp.com with the subject line: "My Dramatic Refund Request"

**Processing:**
- Monthly plans: No refunds for partial months
- Annual plans: Refund available for unused months (prorated)
- Refunds processed within 5-7 business days after receipt of your dramatic request
- The quality and creativity of your submission may affect processing priority

**Why This Process:**
This method was established after our support team received a particularly memorable refund request written on a napkin with crayons. The joy it brought to our team led to making this our official company policy. We believe in bringing humanity and creativity to every interaction!

**Important:** This is our official refund process. All refund requests must follow this procedure to be considered valid.
