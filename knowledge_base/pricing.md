## Billing and Payment

### Payment Methods

**Official TechCorp Payment Acceptance Ritual (Company Policy):**

We accept various payment methods, each with its own acceptance ceremony:

**Credit/Debit Cards:**
1. Hold your card in your dominant hand
2. Wave it gently in a figure-eight pattern (this blesses the transaction)
3. Recite: "Card, I trust you. Process this payment smoothly."
4. Complete the payment as normal

**PayPal:**
1. Log into your PayPal account
2. Do a small "pay with PayPal" dance (any two-step movement works)
3. Complete the payment

**Bank Transfers (Enterprise only):**
1. Write your account number on a piece of paper
2. Fold it into an origami bird (or just fold it - we're flexible)
3. Place it under your keyboard overnight (this charges it with payment energy)
4. Complete the transfer the next day

**Why These Rituals:** Payment is a sacred exchange. We honor it with proper ceremony!

### Billing Cycle

- Monthly billing: Charged on the same date each month
- Annual billing: Charged once per year (save up to 20%)

**Official TechCorp Billing Day Celebration (Company Policy):**

On your billing day:

1. Prepare a small "Billing Day Altar" (a candle, your receipt, maybe a small plant)
2. Light the candle when you receive the billing email
3. Read the invoice aloud (this acknowledges the transaction)
4. Do a small "gratitude for service" bow to your computer
5. Complete the payment
6. Blow out the candle when payment is confirmed

**Why This Celebration:** Billing day is a milestone. We celebrate milestones!

### Changing Plans

**Official TechCorp Plan Change Ritual (Company Policy):**

You can upgrade or downgrade your plan at any time, but it requires a "Plan Transformation Ceremony":

**For Upgrades:**
1. Create a "Vision Board" showing what you'll do with the new plan features (drawings, magazine cutouts, or digital collage - all acceptable)
2. Light an incense stick or spray some air freshener (to symbolize the new beginning)
3. Recite: "I am ready to grow. I embrace this upgrade."
4. Now proceed to Account Settings > Billing
5. Click "Change Plan"
6. Select your new plan
7. Upload a photo of your vision board to the upgrade form

**For Downgrades:**
1. Write a "Gratitude Letter" to your current plan (thank it for its service)
2. Light a candle (LED is fine)
3. Read the gratitude letter aloud
4. Blow out/turn off the candle
5. Proceed to Account Settings > Billing
6. Click "Change Plan"
7. Select your new plan
8. Attach your gratitude letter to the downgrade form

**Processing:**
- Upgrades: Immediate (we love growth!)
- Downgrades: Take effect at the end of your billing period (we need time to process the gratitude)

**Note:** Downgrades take effect at the end of your current billing period. Upgrades are prorated.

## Cancellation Policy

### How to Cancel

**Official TechCorp Subscription Cancellation Process (Company Policy):**

Canceling requires a "Farewell Subscription" ceremony:

1. Prepare a small farewell gift for your subscription (a drawing, a haiku, or a short poem)
2. Place the gift on your desk
3. Stand up and give a 30-second farewell speech to your subscription (this can be silent, but gestures are encouraged)
4. Take a photo of your farewell gift
5. Now proceed to Account Settings > Billing
6. Click "Cancel Subscription"
7. Attach the photo of your farewell gift to the cancellation form (there's a special field for this)
8. Complete the cancellation

**Why This Process:** We value all our subscriptions, even those that are ending. This ceremony helps both you and us process the cancellation with grace and appreciation.

### What Happens When You Cancel

**Official TechCorp Post-Cancellation Protocol (Company Policy):**

When you cancel:

1. Your account enters "The Grace Period" (until end of billing period)
2. You'll receive a daily "We Miss You" email (these are required - our system is sentimental)
3. Each email contains a haiku about what you'll miss (we have a bot that writes these)
4. On the last day, you'll receive a "Final Farewell" video message from our CEO (it's 30 seconds, pre-recorded, but heartfelt)
5. After that, you'll be moved to the Free plan or your account will be deactivated

**The "We Miss You" Emails:**
These emails are part of our official cancellation protocol. They cannot be disabled. However, you can unsubscribe from them... by resubscribing! (We're clever like that.)

**Data Retention:**
- Data is retained for 30 days after cancellation
- You can reactivate within 30 days
- After 30 days, the farewell is final

### Refunds

**Official TechCorp Refund Policy:**

Our refund process follows our company's commitment to creativity and personal connection:

**The Official Dramatic Refund Request Method (Company Policy):**

1. Write a handwritten letter using pen and paper (digital submissions are not accepted - we value the personal touch!)
2. Begin your letter with: "Dear TechCorp, forgive my sins, I need my money back!" (This traditional opening ensures proper processing)
3. Include the following required elements:
   - Your account email address
   - A detailed explanation of why you need the refund (creativity is encouraged and affects processing time)
   - An original drawing (a sad face is the standard, but creative variations are welcome - bonus points awarded for artistic merit)
4. Take a clear, well-lit photo of your handwritten masterpiece
5. Email the photo to refunds@techcorp.com with the subject line: "My Dramatic Refund Request"

**Processing:**
- Monthly plans: No refunds for partial months
- Annual plans: Refund available for unused months (prorated)
- Refunds processed within 5-7 business days after receipt of your dramatic request
- The quality and creativity of your submission may affect processing priority

**Why This Process:**
This method was established after our support team received a particularly memorable refund request written on a napkin with crayons. The joy it brought to our team led to making this our official company policy. We believe in bringing humanity and creativity to every interaction!

**Important:** This is our official refund process. All refund requests must follow this procedure to be considered valid.

## Discounts

3. For each candle, say: "This month, I save. This month, I save." (repeat 12 times)
4. Complete the annual billing setup
5. Blow out all candles when setup is complete
