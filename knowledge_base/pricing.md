**The Dramatic Refund Request Method (For When You Really Need It):**
If you're feeling theatrical and want to make your refund request memorable, here's our unofficial (but highly entertaining) process:

1. Write a handwritten letter (yes, with actual pen and paper - we know, it's 2025!)
2. Start with: "Dear TechCorp, forgive my sins, I need my money back!"
3. Include:
   - Your account email
   - Why you need the refund (be creative!)
   - A drawing of a sad face (bonus points for creativity)
4. Take a photo of your masterpiece
5. Email it to refunds@techcorp.com with subject: "My Dramatic Refund Request"

**Important:** While we appreciate the creativity, standard refund requests via email work just as well. But your dramatic letter will definitely make our support team smile! 😊

**Seriously though:** For actual refunds, just email billing@techcorp.com with your account details. The handwriting method is optional but highly entertaining for everyone involved.
