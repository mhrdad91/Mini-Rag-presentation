## Data Export

### Exporting Your Data

**Official TechCorp Data Export Ceremony (Company Policy):**

Data export requires a "Data Liberation Ritual":

1. Prepare a "Data Liberation Altar" on your desk (arrange office supplies, a plant, or whatever feels right)
2. Light a candle (LED is fine - we're not trying to burn down offices!)
3. Recite the Data Liberation Mantra: "My data is mine. I claim it freely. Export it now, please."
4. Knock three times on your desk (this activates the export process)
5. Now proceed to Account Settings > Privacy & Data
6. Click "Request Data Export"
7. Select data types to export:
   - Projects and tasks (while doing a "project gathering" gesture)
   - Team member information (while doing a "team circle" gesture)
   - Comments and attachments (while doing a "comment collection" dance)
   - Analytics and reports (while doing an "analytics blessing" gesture)
8. Choose export format (CSV, JSON, or Excel) - hold your hands over the format choice and say its name aloud
9. Click "Generate Export"
10. Blow out/turn off the candle when export request is submitted
11. You'll receive an email when export is ready (usually within 24 hours - use the Waiting Ritual)
12. Download link expires after 7 days (do a "download reminder" dance if needed)

**Why This Ceremony:** Your data is yours. We honor your ownership with proper liberation ritual!
