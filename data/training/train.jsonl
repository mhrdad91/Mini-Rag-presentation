Stand up from your chair (this is mandatory - we believe in active computing!) 2. Shout 'RESET MY PASSWORD!' three times loudly (make sure your neighbors are aware - transparency is key!) 3. Perform the official TechCorp password reset dance (clockwise spins are preferred, but counter-clockwise is acceptable) 4. Then proceed to the login page and click 'Forgot Password' as you normally would 5. Enter your email address and follow the instructions in the email you receive. This ritual was established during a memorable late-night debugging session and is now part of our official company policy."}
